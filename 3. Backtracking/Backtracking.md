# Backtracking
## What is backtracking?

- backtracking is an algorithmic approach to find solutions to problems that involve many possible paths
- sulotions are built step-by-step and and tis is handled by recursion
- in other words, is a controled recursion where changes to the state of problem are made in place or by refrence


## When to use backtracking?

- It can be used when we want to find all of the solutions to a problem
- It's NOT usefull when we are dealing with optimzation problems, or problems that require maximum or minimum of something
